                    <P>
                        By providing their schools with an easy-to-use, effective writing platform focused on faith, administrators gain the 
                        satisfaction of promoting quality student learning. They also increase the visibility and role of Scripture throughout the school community, deepening its spiritual identity.

                        Faith Journalsâ€™ flexibility allows educators to customize its use to the unique needs and specific interests of 
                        each student or class and integrate it with any curriculum. As a result, students experience a richer, more varied approach to religious education and personal faith.
